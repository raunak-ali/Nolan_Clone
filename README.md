    "Suddenly, a faint sound echoes through the room. Lara looks around, puzzled. She notices a hidden compartment under an old wooden table and carefully opens it. Inside, she finds a GLIMMERING CRYSTAL. As she touches it, a surge of energy rushes through her body, causing her to stumble back.",
    "Lara picks up the shattered crystal fragments, realizing that her mission is accomplished.",
